[Lunatik for Playstation 1](https://www.unseen64.net/2020/11/16/lunatik-pure-entertainment-cancelled/#comment-377406) - This was a game I worked on in 1996/7 that ended up being cancelled by EIDOS. We had major problems trying to make this into a 3D Defender, and that primarily is why it was canned.

This is an early playable version I found on an old CD. It runs ok on RetroArch ReARMed (from the `/cdrom` folder). 

The rules (as far I can tell and with all the caveats of it not really being a fully fledged game idea!) are:
* Collect the glowing balls - you have to hover over them so they rise up for collection
* Once you've done that - kill the boss gun
* Don't get shot ;) 

I _believe_ there are 3 levels.

I don't remember much about this build, it certainly has bugs and seems to be a bit slow at times, so could either be running with my C engine, or my to-the-metal MIPS asm engine - it seems to struggle when there's lots going on, so it's possibly the former.  One thing I do know is that later in the project the level loading was super quick, and it isn't quick here, so it could be quite early - I think it may have been a demo for E3. Really don't remember though!
