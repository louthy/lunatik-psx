# lunatik-psx

Lunatik for for Playstation 1 - This was a game I worked on in 1996/7 that ended up being cancelled by EIDOS.

This is a playable version I found on an old CD. It runs ok on RetroArch ReARMed (from the `/image` folder). 

I don't remember anything about this build, it certainly has bugs and seems to be a bit slow at times, so could either be running with my C engine, or my hardcore MIPS asm engine but still struggling with everything going on.  Really don't remember!
